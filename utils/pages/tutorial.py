Compounds with higher LogP values may be too lipophilic, which could lead to poor solubility in aqueous environments.
    - **Hydrogen Bond Donors $\le 5$**
    	- **Explanation**: This criterion limits the number of hydrogen bond donors (e.g., -OH and -NH groups) in a molecule to 5 or fewer. Excessive hydrogen bonding can increase the molecule‚Äôs polarity, making it less likely to permeate cell membranes and potentially affecting oral bioavailability.
    - **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors $\le 10$**
    	- **Explanation**: This criterion limits the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g., oxygen and nitrogen atoms) in a molecule to 10 or fewer. Like hydrogen bond donors, excessive hydrogen bond acceptors can also affect a compound‚Äôs ability to cross biological membranes and impact its absorption and permeability.

    - If you want to calculate Lipinski for a single molecule then paste the corresponding SMILES formula in the provided box.
    - If you want to perform Lipinski's calculation for bulk amount of ligands then upload a **_.txt_** file containing SMILES notation of each ligand. Make sure that the text file has only one SMILES per line.
